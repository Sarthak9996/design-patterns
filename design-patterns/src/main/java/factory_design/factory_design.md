Factory Design Pattern - Properties
1. Creational design pattern
2. Used when we have multiple sub-classes of a Super class & based on input we want to return one class instance.
3. It provides abstraction between implementation & client classes.
4. Remove the instantiation of client classes from client code.


Implementation: 
1. Super class can be interface or abstract class or basic class.
2. Factory class has a static method which returns the instance of Sub-class based on input.

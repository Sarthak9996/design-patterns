Prototype Design Pattern - Properties
1. Creational Design Pattern.
2. Used when we want to avoid multiple Object creation of same instance; instead you copy the object to new object & then we can modify as per our need.


Implementation:
1. Object which we're copying should provide copying feature by implementing Cloneable interface.
2. We can override clone() method to implement as per our need.

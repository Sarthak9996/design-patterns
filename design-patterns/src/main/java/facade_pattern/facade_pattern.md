Facade Design Pattern - Properties
1. Structural Design Pattern
2. Used when there're multiple interfaces of similar kind of jobs, then we add a Facade interface, which provide better interface to these interfaces and clients. It basically helps in routing to related interface. i.e. Drivers, Databases


Implementation:
1. We'll implement a Facade helper class, which will route to method related to specific class based on input.
